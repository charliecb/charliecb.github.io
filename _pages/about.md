I’m a second year Ph.D. student at MIT, in the department of pure mathematics (during first year, EECS department). I’m broadly interested in the intersection of **mathematical analysis, probability, and machine learning**. I’m particularly interested in **reliable AI for science** (e.g. how can we make valid statistical inference using black boxes) and **for math** (e.g. how can we prove existence of solutions to PDEs using black boxes). I'm also lucky to be supported by an [NDSEG fellowship](https://ndseg.org).

During 2023-2024, I was lucky to work with [Stephen Bates](https://stephenbates19.github.io) on statistical inference with black boxes. During my undergraduate work at Princeton, I studied pure mathematics and was very lucky to work with [Ching-Yao Lai](https://icyphysics.stanford.edu). During my masters degree in mathematics (“Part III”) at the University of Cambridge, I worked with [Sofia Villar](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/staff/sofia-villar) on alternative schemes to test experimental treatments in the medical community. Previously, I also interned at Meta Reality Labs.

I’m also a co-creator of the [Logion](https://www.logionproject.princeton.edu/) project, with Creston Brooks, Johannes Haubold, and Barbara Graziosi, the project to identify and correct mistakes in ancient manuscripts.
